# Description

In computational linguistics and probability, an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words, or base pairs according to the application. The n-grams are typically collected from a text or speech corpus. This program, "My Ngram," counts the occurrences of each character in one or multiple strings.

# Task

I wrote a program "my_ngram" that takes 1 or more strings as an argument. It shows each character and the number of occurrences, one per line.

# Usage

./my_ngram text [text2, text3]

# Installation

After downloading the code, type make or mingw32-make in the terminal
